# Papes
A native Android app for wallpapers. Developed as part of a native Android
development course at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences.

The app is written in Kotlin and follows the MVVM architecture pattern with some
clean architecture principles applied.

It uses the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) to fetch images.
